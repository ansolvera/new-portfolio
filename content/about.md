I'm a web designer and front-end developer from Orange County, California. I'm 29 years old, and I've been building websites for the past four years.

I'm a recovering perfectionist, dog lover, caffeine ~~addict~~ enthusiast, baker, athlete, world traveler, and a damn good web designer (if I do say so myself).

### How it started ...

I got started in web design in 2017, while I was in grad school trying to build a freelance copywriting business on the side.

Sadly, that business never took off because I couldn't figure out how the f#%k to build a website (R.I.P.).

Instead of studying for my exams, I regularly stayed up until way past midnight watching YouTube videos and browsing Reddit threads learning how to customize a simple WordPress theme.

I had no idea what the hell I was doing, but I had a blast learning all of the ins and outs of building a website. So I kept learning ... and learning ... and I've never stopped.

### How it's going ...

Since then, I've taught myself graphic design, web design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in addition to other tools like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and [Webflow](https://webflow.com).

Although my focus is constantly changing, I'm currently learning all I can about the JAMstack and static-site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com)––which together offer many of the features associated with full-fledged web applications minus the headache.

I also share a lot of what I've learned on my [blog](/posts). And my writing has been featured in several online publications,––including **Prototypr,** **UX Planet,** and the **Data-Driven Investor**––where it has been shared among thousands of readers.

Everything I know about web design and development is self-taught. I've always loved to learn, and I'm extremely grateful to be working in a field in which constant learning is a plus.

Now I work with online business owners, helping them out so they don't have to spend years learning how to build a website like I did.

### A bit more

**I was born** and raised in beautiful southern California. And I lived in Washington, D.C. for four years while I was going to college. Now I live in Orange County, just 10 minutes from the ocean. 

**I have a few hobbies.** I love to bake, and when I'm not sitting in front of the computer, you can usually find me in the kitchen either proofing bread dough or frosting a cake. 

**On the weekends,** I play in a gay kickball league with my friends. My team is called The Sirens, and we are terrible. I play outfield.
